## Hello everyone,
### I'm Omer, I'm working on Android and I'm currently improving myself on the Kotlin language. This repository contains Kekod Kotlin Boot Camp codes. I hope it will be useful to you.
## I would like to thank our teacher Gokhan Ozturk, who deserves the greatest praise for this course.
